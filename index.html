                                As a kid, I could be found either with a pencil in my hand or in front of a computer. Eventually I decided to combine the two and started studying Game-Design (Focussing on Concept Art). Despite my still lingering interest in Game-Development, this didn't work out and I quit before I finished the study. After graduating for my follow up study Art: Decoration and Restoration, I was still left unsatisfied.
                                <br><br>
                                While working for my brother as a house painter I decided to re-evaluate what I wanted out of a job. In my spare time, I started looking into programming, as my curiosity was triggered by an HTML course I had done during my study. My interest in it came as a surprise!
                                <br><br>
                                I find it offers both breadth and depth, yet is more tangible and less subjective than art. It satisfies both the creative and analytical parts of my brain and it started to dawn on me that it was a far better fit, job-wise, than art.
                                In art I like to have full control, it's something I'd rather do for fun and to express myself and I wouldn't enjoy having to make concessions for a paying customer. With programming, I don't have this problem. Of course, there are certain types of projects I prefer to work on, but I enjoy the whole process of it. It's challenging and there's always something new to learn which only fuels my enthusiasm more!

                        Since a study used to be no option due to financial reasons, two years ago I started teaching myself programming with the help of the internet. However, before I decided to pursue it more seriously and shifted my focus towards Front-End Development, I made some projects in GameMakerLanguage and have worked a little in C#.
                        <br><br>
                        Throughout these two years, I've made multiple personal projects, including this website which I'm currently planning to re-design. Below you can find links to some of my projects along with a short description. Most of these projects were made with the goal in mind of learning a specific language or framework. Some are simply passion projects or experiments.</p>

                        <p>
                        My first projects were written in GML, using GameMaker Studio 2. I've made several small projects consisting of modular game mechanics that can be used by other creators in their own game-related projects. 
                        <br><br>
                        Even though I stopped working in GameMaker Studio quite some time ago, my projects are still being downloaded today, currently estimating at 1300+ downloads.
                        <br><br>
                        Among other things, working with GML gave me a basic understanding of if-statements, for-loops, switches, and finite-state machines. It also taught me the importance of project scope and the dangers of feature creep.

                            One of the bigger projects I have made in C# as Console Application is a 2D Map Generator using Simplex Noise to generate it's landmass and biomes. The generated maps can be saved (and loaded) as JSON files and can be navigated using the arrow-keys, which allows for the selection of individual grid-cells and reading out their data.
                            <br><br>
                            This project taught me my first lessons in C#, the importance of keeping my code organized and made me familiar with the use of libraries.

                        <p>My interest in generative art led me to try out the p5.js library. After a few experiments, I made a simple generator that uses the Random-Walker technique to generate and draw visuals (influenced by several adjustable variables) onto a HTML Canvas.
                        <br><br>    
                        Working on this project taught more about organizing, refactoring and commenting my code.</p>

                        <p>To learn more about Javascript frameworks I made a project in Angular 8, namely, a digital Dice Roller with a variety of die to choose from.

                        Making this Dice Roller showed me the value of Javascript frameworks, made me more familiar with HTML and CSS and was my first attempt at responsive design.

                        <p>
                            When I began to become more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JS, I started wondering if I could recreate my Map Generator using the p5.js library. This time using sprites for visuals instead of simple symbols and letters. This went easier than expected and the project turned out far better than my C# Map Generator.
                            <br><br>
                            It uses Perlin Noise to generate its maps, has a menu to manipulate the generation process, and has different visual options. There's still a lot to improve but it has been a great learning experience.
                            <br><br>
                            The size of this project made it a challenge to keep things organized and while I still struggle with this skillset, I'm looking forward to learning more about it. Working on this, I gained more knowledge about HTML, CSS, Javascript, and p5.js. I also learned more about binding UI to logic and dynamically creating HTML input elements.

                            Since I started making more HTML Canvas based projects, I decided to create a Responsive Template UI that makes it easier to hook up a menu to a canvas project's logic.
                            <br><br>
                            Looking back now it might have been better to create this program in a framework like React, but working on it has definitely taught me something. It deepened my understanding of responsive design and taught me more about modular design.

                            Having struggled a little with Angular and knowing that React was another popular JS framework made me curious to learn more about it. To get more familiar with communication between components, a friend advised me to try making a Minesweeper clone with several difficulty options.
                            <br><br>
                            This project made me more capable of using React and taught me how to better organize my code into smaller functions. I definitely favor React over Angular now!

                            A while ago I was rethinking my website and considered adding a blog. I chose not to use any existing tools like WordPress, since I wanted to make it myself, for fun and for practice. 
                            <br><br>
                            Even though I haven't added the blog to my site yet, due to having no time to write any content, it's functional and doesn't need a server to store its posts, other than it's own Github repository.
                            <br><br>
                            This project taught me how to work with constraints (having limited time to learn about servers and storing data) and come up with creative solutions.
